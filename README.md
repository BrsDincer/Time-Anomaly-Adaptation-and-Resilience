# Time Anomaly Adaptation and Resilience Simulation Project

## Overview

It models an adaptive ecosystem where entities (organisms) interact within a dynamically changing environment influenced by chaos theory, particularly the Lorenz attractor, and anomaly detection mechanisms.

## Simulation Hypothesis

The simulation integrates concepts from chaos theory, using the Lorenz attractor system to introduce unpredictable and non-linear dynamics into the environment. Additionally, it employs a mechanism for organisms to detect and adapt to environmental anomalies or "matrix errors," reflecting a learning process and behavioral adaptation.

## Key Concepts

- **Chaos Theory and Lorenz Attractor**: The Lorenz system comprises a set of differential equations that exhibit chaotic behavior and sensitivity to initial conditions, influencing the simulation's environmental dynamics.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Organisms in the simulation learn to detect anomalies over time, adapting their behavior based on these occurrences.
- **Adaptive Learning**: Organisms adapt and change their behavior in response to the frequency and nature of anomalies, modeled through a threshold-based detection system.
